## How to get the channel list from TBS Online?

### Requirements
To get the channel list from TBS Online, you need these following stuff:
* Internet connection
* IPTV Player (with Radio stations working), like VLC Media Player - IPTV Players like IPTV Smarters Pro, XCIPTV etc. are also compatible for TBS Online, but you need to know that radio stations won't work on these Players. That's why it's better to get an IPTV Players that also supports radio stations. - My top recommendation is iMPlayer Mobile (Android)/iMPlayer TV IPTV Player (Android TV)/VLC Media Player (Windows/Linux/macOS/iOS/iPad OS/Apple TV)
* TBS Online .m3u-Link

### Step 1: Copy link
First of all, how the f*** did you get to my Github... No, I'm just kidding. First of all, you need a compatible software. Most of the devices today are compatible for TBS Online. Then you need an IPTV Player (I as an example have iMPlayer Mobile for my Android phone and VLC Media Player on my Windows PC), or you can go to https://iptvnator.vercel.app/ and enjoy TBS Online without install any IPTV Player. Now just follow this step:
* Go to master.m3u
* Go to the button on the right with the word Raw on it
* No click on the URL and copy it

### Alternative option: Downloading
Alternatively you can also just downloading it. And these are the following steps:
* Go to master.m3u
* Instead of going to the Raw button, go to the Download icon on the right
* Save it to your PC/Smartphone/TV
* Downside: The playlist you have just downloaded won't update after some changes on TBS Online. That's why it is better to use the copy and paste option to keep TBS Online up-to-date

### Step 2: Open, Paste and that's it
Now open your IPTV Player and paste the link. Yeah... I think I will explain it for some IPTV Players:
* iMPlayer Mobile (Android): Go to the Add Playlist button, than choose M3U & EPG. Nickname BTW can be anything you want, but on M3U Link you need to paste the link you have copied. As EPG isn't available on TBS Online, putting an EPG link isn't necessary. Now go to next. If the setup is complete, go to Finish, and you can now listening to TBS Radio. TBS on your ears! Sorry, It won't be happening again!
* More players coming soon
