## How to get the channel list from TBS Online?

### Requirements
To get the channel list from TBS Online, you need these following stuff:
* Internet connection
* IPTV Player (with Radio stations working), like VLC Media Player - IPTV Players like IPTV Smarters Pro, XCIPTV etc. are also compatible for TBS Online, but you need to know that radio stations won't work on these Players. That's why it's better to get an IPTV Player that also supports radio stations. - My top recommendation is iMPlayer Mobile (Android)/iMPlayer TV IPTV Player (Android TV)/VLC Media Player (Windows/Linux/macOS/iOS/iPad OS/Apple TV)
* TBS Online .m3u-Link

### Step 1: Copy link
First of all, how the f*** did you get to my Github... No, I'm just kidding. First of all, you need a compatible software. Most of the devices today are compatible for TBS Online. Then you need an IPTV Player (I as an example have iMPlayer Mobile for my Android phone and VLC Media Player on my Windows PC), or you can go to https://iptvnator.vercel.app/ and enjoy TBS Online without install any IPTV Player. Now just follow this step:
* Go to master.m3u
* Go to the button on the right with the word Raw on it
* Now click on the URL and copy it

### Alternative option: Downloading
Alternatively you can also just downloading it. And these are the following steps:
* Go to master.m3u
* Instead of going to the Raw button, go to the Download icon on the right
* Save it to your PC/Smartphone/TV
* Downside: The playlist you have just downloaded won't update after some changes on TBS Online. That's why it is better to use the copy and paste option to keep TBS Online up-to-date

### Step 2: Open, Paste and that's it
Now open your IPTV Player and paste the link. Yeah... I think I will explain it further for some IPTV Players:
* iMPlayer Mobile (Android): Go to the Add Playlist button, than choose M3U & EPG. Nickname BTW can be anything you want, but on M3U Link you need to paste the link you have copied. As EPG isn't available on TBS Online, putting an EPG link isn't necessary. Now go to next. If the setup is complete, go to Finish, and you can now listening to TBS Radio. TBS on your ears! Sorry, It won't happen again!
* Televizo (Android): Go to Create playlist, than choose New M3U playlist. Playlist name BTW can be anything you want, but on Link to the playlist you need to paste the link you have copied. Now you have more options for your list. First we have "Turn on playlist". It must be activated for the playlist working. Second we have "How often to update?". Choose how often the playlist will update, but never choose "Never", otherwise you can say goodbye to the new channels coming to TBS Online. At third and fourth we have "Archive type" and "Archive duration". Seriously, I don't know anything about these 2 options, so that we will go to the next option which is "Load EPG from playlist (if available)". You can deactivate that, as TBS Online dosen't include any EPG. Also about the last option "Use all program guides" I don't know anything. Now click on the check icon. Now we will get a warning, that Televizo is not responsible for any of a playlist. Click on "Don't show again", if you want to add another playlist in the future and go to Save. Now you have all currently available channels on the TBS Online m3u list. See you next time.
* More players coming soon
